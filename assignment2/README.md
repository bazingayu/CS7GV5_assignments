this is the code for TCD CS7GV5 for RealTime Animation Trinity College Dublin


• You are required to design and animate two hierarchical 3D creatures, using simple
primitives such as blocks, spheres and cylinders. One creature can have a simple 3-bone (with
two links) structure, with a 1-1 relationship between each parent-child. The second creature
should be more complex, with at least 5 bones and at least one 1-many relationship (e.g.,
torso with two independent links).


• You should animate the creatures using both forward and inverse kinematics (IK). Analytical
solutions to IK are the most straightforward and can be used for the simple model. For the
more complex creature, other approaches (CCD, Jacobian) should be investigated.
