this is the code for TCD CS7GV5 RealTime animation assignment 1.

Requirments: 

You are required to create a simple model of an aeroplane and use the keyboard and mouse input
to display pitch, roll and yaw rotations of the aeroplane â€“ you should also implement three extra
features, as described in the Requirements below; 

You can use the glm maths library (or other), or create your own. Remember that OpenGL uses
column-order matrices so if you are using a math library that assumes row-order, you will have
to get the transpose of the resulting matrix. Remember to check the structure of the translation
matrix to help figure this out. You can also download the basic cylinder object class from
Blackboard, if you would like to use a cylinder to represent the aeroplane.
